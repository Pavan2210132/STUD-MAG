# Student-Attendance-Management-System
The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda Student Attendance Management System is designed to automate the process of taking student attendance and generating attendance reports for the same.

This live Web-Based Attendance System & Mobile Application is beneficial for students and teaching staff of the university.This is an attempt to remove the existing flaws in the Manual system of taking attendance.

I have developed this as part of my Internship as a ___Student Intern___ at ___The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda___ under the guidance of my professor Mr Vishwas Raval.
